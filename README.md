# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository contains Minor Machine Learning Projects.
This Projects are completed by me for self learning and hobby purposes.

	- [PNB stock prediction](https://github.com/SaileshP97/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/6e7ad6de60a29ad3c5636c6779f42c28eb498041/Titanic%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20from%20Disaster/titanic-competition.ipynb): In this project I tried to predict stock price of punjab natioal bank(PNB). I visualized the data and tested for trend using linear and polynomial regression. Also tested for stationarity using adfuller. Then to build a predicting model I used RNN with 3 LSTM layers. It took Open price for last 60 days and predicted the price of next day. The MSE obtained after predicting test data was 4.723246.
	   
	- [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://github.com/SaileshP97/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/6e7ad6de60a29ad3c5636c6779f42c28eb498041/Titanic%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20from%20Disaster/titanic-competition.ipynb): Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations. Created two model one using ANN and another using RandomForest. The data was taken from Kaggle. The task was to predict a passenger would survive or not.


	- [MNIST - Number Recognition using CNN](https://github.com/SaileshP97/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/ffdcd625a3a1da21a16f045e1261407171554a51/CNN_MNIST_Number%20recognition/CNN_MNIST.ipynb): The Data is been extracted from Tensorflow dataset. In this project i have used Convolutional neural network to Categorize the Number's image into correct Number Category. This project was made by me while doing a Course on Tensorflow.


	- [California_Housing](https://github.com/SaileshP97/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/2edff1db33749d19227cda555ab83de10cbb5e7c/California_Housing/california_housing.ipynb): The Data was provided during one of my course on DataScience. In this Project i need to predict the Sale Price of house using some features. To do so i used 4 different models. Linear Regression, ANN, Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression. Out of this Random Forest performed better than rest.


	- [Credit Card Approver](https://github.com/SaileshP97/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/cf74b138c161b6f2cd6cbb02dde957582452aeda/Credit%20Card%20Approver/credit-card-approver.ipynb): The Data Set has been downloaded from Kaggle. There were 2 data set one Application and credit record which is linked by ID. In this Project i used Random Forest Classifier to predict whether or not to approve Credit Card to a person depending on the details provided.

	- [Credit Card Lead Prediction](https://github.com/SaileshP97/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/0649e7688b874deeb947cfb05c909b58b4bd9901/Analytic%20Vidya%20Jobathon/Credit%20Card%20Lead%20Prediction.ipynb): This code was written during a competition in Analytics Vidya. We need to predict whether a person is interested in credit card or not. I used Deep learning to predict. My ROC was 0.8700320345.
